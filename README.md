Repository for the returntasks of the course

Almost but no cigar, I just would've needed 1 day of so more to complete these totally.
I made total map of the functionalities of the last task 3 and 4, and was just about to apply the
validation, so that the buy button would appear.  
So far validation of the user worked. 

These I got done from the fourth task:

Shop products

* create new product (name, manufacturer, category, description, NOT IMAGE. 

* get all products

* get single product

* modify product

* Search for products based on name, manufacturer, category

User

* Create user (basic information name, address etc.)
   - Not mentioned on the list: Validation of the user for log on.
